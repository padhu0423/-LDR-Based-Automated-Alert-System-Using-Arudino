# -LDR-Based-Automated-Alert-System-Using-Arudino
This project develops an automated alert system using an Arduino microcontroller, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), a buzzer, and an LED to monitor ambient light levels and provide timely notifications. The system continuously measures light intensity and activates both the buzzer and LED when the light falls below a predefined threshold. This dual-alert mechanism enhances user awareness in low-light conditions, making it suitable for applications in home automation, industrial safety, and educational environments. The system is designed to be energy-efficient, adaptable, and cost-effective, with potential for scalability and customization based on varying needs.
